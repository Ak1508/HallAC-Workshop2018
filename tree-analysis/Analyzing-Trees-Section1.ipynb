    "\n",
    "ROOT trees are optimized for the <span style=\"color:red\">storage</span> of the kind of data produced in high-energy and nuclear physics experiments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Very large numbers of _events_ with essentially the same data structure\n",
    "* Variable length containers holding identical data/objects\n",
    "* Tree-like structures of collections of objects, similar to databases\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:red\">Access patterns</span> to data in ROOT trees are also optimized for the kinds we typically need for our analyses:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Column-wise\" reading of individual data elementsâ€”only the element(s) of interest are read, not entire events\n",
    "* Only one event (or part of it) in memory at a time (modulo buffer size)\n",
    "* Buffered to disk, some degree of integrity protection during writing (\"cycles\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Without structures like ROOT trees, the efficient analysis of petabyte-size data sets from CERN and elsewhere would be nearly impossible. ROOT trees\n",
    "\n",
    "* minimize memory requirements and I/O\n",
    "* greatly enhance access speed\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to simple n-tuple-like data, ROOT <span style=\"color:red\">lets you write C++ objects to file</span>. This is impossible in native C++ and is achieved through class dictionaries generated with the _Cling_ C++ interpreter/compiler. The ability to write <span style=\"color:red\">entire object trees</span> is critical for storing the very complex event data from HEP experiments. This is also knows as \"C++ object persistency\". Some programming languages offer object persistency natively, but not C++."

    "## Hall A Analyzer trees\n",
    "\n",
    "ROOT trees produced by the Hall A and Hall C analyzers have a rather simple structure. Each \"global variable\" (analysis result) selected for output to the tree is written to its own branch with only a single leaf. The name of the branch is identical to the name of the global variable, for example ```L.tr.p```. At this time, data branches always have the type ```Double_t```. We are planning to support other data types, in particular integers, starting with analyzer version 1.7.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of arrays, a second branch is written to the tree whose name is ```Ndata.``` followed by the name of the corresponding array, _e.g._ ```Ndata.L.tr.p```. These branches always have type ```Int_t``` and hold the number of elements in the array for the current event. There is a lot of redundancy in ```Ndata``` variables for various elements of a single object, such as the collection of tracks. We may reduce or even eliminate this redundancy in a future version of the analyzer."

    "<li> __Scan__: Prints a table where each row corresponds to an event and and each column, to the branch data. If there are multiple entries in a variable-sized array, multiple rows are printed for a single event, each row corresponding to the array index, called \"Instance\". Allows quick comparison of a number of columns (often faster and clearer than plotting).\n",
    "<li> __Show__: Prints all data for a single event. The output can be large. Helps with understanding the data structure. Often used for inspecting unusual events such as misreconstructed tracks.\n",

While this is convenient for distinguishing, say, a zero reading from the \"never read\" case, unfortunately this convention also makes it difficult to plot any tree variables with at least a trivial cut like ```abs(L.tr.x)<10``` because there will always be some events that weren't fully computed, e.g. because of missing track data etc."
